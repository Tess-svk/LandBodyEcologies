"Solastalgia is rooted in a lived experience of place and bound within how one defines their home, their land and identity."


Solastalgia is a project led by the Land Body Ecologies Group; Ayesha Ahmad, Invisible Flock, Kaisa Kerätär, Quicksand and Sheila Ghelani. The project has been shortlisted for a Wellcome Trust Hub Award.

Since early 2019 the Land body Ecologies Research group has been working together to explore the relationship between mental health and ecosystem health. Our group is a multidisciplinary team bridging but not limited to psychology, arts, sustainability, sociology, design and medicine. We have come together through the belief that to better understand the impacts of environmental change on mental health this conversation needs to happen in a global intersectional space, in direct collaboration with those with lived experience of environmental changes to their land historically and presently.
